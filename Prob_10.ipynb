    "   * Restrict to a **date range** (`request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'`).\n",

    "\n",
    "   * Using `COUNT(CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 END)` to count only **cancelled** trips.\n",
    "   * Using `COUNT(*)` for total trips.\n",

    "5. **Numeric computation**\n",

    "   * Dividing one aggregate by another and multiplying by 100.\n",
    "   * Using `ROUND(..., 2)` to round to 2 decimal places.\n",
    "   * Awareness of integer vs decimal division.\n",

    "   * Which table contains attributes about users? → `Users`\n",

    "2. **Clarify who/what to include**\n",
    "\n",

    "   * Only trips within a date range.\n",
    "   * Only certain statuses count as \"cancelled\".\n",

    "   * What is the “per X” in the question?\n",

    "   * **Total trips per day**: `COUNT(*)`\n",
    "   * **Cancelled trips per day**: `COUNT(CASE WHEN status IN (...) THEN 1 END)`\n",

    "  * FROM → JOIN → WHERE → GROUP BY → SELECT.\n",
    "* The DB engine figures out the optimal execution plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PySpark mindset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You chain **transformations** on DataFrames.\n",
    "* Each step is a transformation: `join`, `where`, `groupBy`, `agg`, `withColumn`, `select`.\n",
    "* You explicitly build a **pipeline** of operations.\n",
    "* Execution is lazy: nothing runs until you perform an action (`show`, `collect`, `write` etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually they are the same operations, but:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SQL = one declarative query.\n",
    "* PySpark = sequence of transformations that logically mirror the SQL but in an API style.\n",

    "## 1️⃣1️⃣ Hints to solve this (without looking at the solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟢 Basic hints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hint 1 (tables):**\n",
    "   Identify the table with trips and the table with user info (banned or not). Ask: “How do I know if a trip’s client or driver is banned?”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hint 2 (double join):**\n",
    "   You need to use the **Users** table twice: once as client, once as driver. This will require **two joins** with different aliases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hint 3 (grouping):**\n",
    "   The answer is “per day”, so think about grouping by the **date column** and using aggregate functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔵 Advanced hints\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hint 4 (conditional count):**\n",
    "   To count only cancelled trips, you don’t filter them out in the WHERE (or you’d lose other statuses). Instead, use something like `COUNT(CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 END)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hint 5 (rate formula):**\n",
    "   The cancellation rate is `cancelled_trips / total_trips * 100`. Both come from aggregates in the same group.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Hint 6 (filters placement):**\n",
    "   Be careful not to put the “cancelled” condition in `WHERE`, or you’ll only keep cancelled trips and lose the denominator. The cancelled condition belongs inside `CASE` in the aggregate.\n",
